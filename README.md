# Thud
A Java implementation of Terry Pratchett's Discworld chesslike game, Thud!

## The game
[Thud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_of_the_Discworld#Thud) is a game mentioned in Terry Pratchett's 34th Discworld novel, *Thud!*.
Trevor Truran created the complete rules of the game.

## Prerequisites
The application is packaged as a multiplatform jar (Java ARchive). You'll find some instructions on how to lauch the jar [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/run.html).
You'll need a JRE install, at least Java 8, which you can download [here](http://www.java.com/fr/download).

The application is standalone, and stores a single configuration file alongside the jar file.

## Credits
Most infos about the game, its rules, and the usual strategies come from Oograh Boike's unofficial Thud page, and from Boike himself.
With the official website of the game (Thudgame.com) down, your most up-to-date source for the rules is probably Wikipedia.
